                The name of the credit memo is not useful as it is a number.

                Option to reactive a one-time sale should not be available.

            <debrief-item question>
                Unable to repeat but we got an credit memo that was $7.97 but the invoice was $10. So we are unsure how or why that happened.
            </debrief-item>
            <debrief-item>
                When we had a credit memo for $10 we tried to apply $5 to the invoice and the later try to add it up to $8. 
                But when we applied the $8 we expected the invoice to have $2 left but it had $0 and was fully paid.
            </debrief-item>
            <debrief-item>
                Voiding the credit memo after it has been applied to an invoice did not work as expected. Nothing seemed to change on the invoice.

                No way to verify which feature flags are enabled for the current organization.

                We should display the feature flags in the organization settings page.

                Organization dropdown in the top left corner of the header has an odd delay even though there is no API calls happening.
